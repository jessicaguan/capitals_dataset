This is the dataset that was used in the uncertainty model testing. 

The purpose of this CSV was to have a number of prompts to use as inputs in the language models to test the uncertainty quantification and visualisation. 
Then, the visualisations of the answers were observed to see if they reflected the accuracy of the responses.
